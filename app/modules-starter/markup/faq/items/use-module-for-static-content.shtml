#ANSWER#		= 'Sometimes a whole module is overkill. If you want to replicate the simplicity of a traditional include, explore the high level <a href="https://codemodules.net/usage/elements-module">Elements module</a>. This one module can contain many traditional includes. One added benefit is that these includes can use the global variables or variables defined in the calling chain. The Elements module is a great place to tuck away a large hunk of markup, e.g. a form. By putting it in its own include, the calling fileâ€™s markup is made more readable.'
